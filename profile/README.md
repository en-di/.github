# EN-DI

All people need access and opportunities to develop their skills, build careers out of their interests and have a chance to discover their identities and purpose (as everyone has one).

We believe, that given proper tools and a platform for collaboration, many neurodivergent people would be able to support themselves and contribute their skills to the benefit of all.

Tech sector has been a safety haven for us and we can take many of the ideas and concepts that made this possible to expand these opportunities to other areas from music and arts to handwork craftsmanship.

## Origins

The name comes from abbreviation "ND", but I like how it becomes almost a name, but not quite. It stands for neurodiversity and neurodivergent, as well as "*n*ot broken, just *d*ifferent" and not disabled. Pick the one that you like most, it's a flexible name!

And the logo is composed out of black and white infinity symbol and a heart. Hearts represents love and compassion, infinity symbol is almost like the ones for neurodiversity and autism, except it's not colored. It's not up to me to decide what's included in the spectrum or not and I wanted the logo to be flexible too - it's an empty canvas, ready to be painted on.
